# fileLink: the substSubsetTimeSerisWGET.txt file with the urls to download; the rest, what was missing

# telling the fileName = just keepring the suffix, thus the filename; tell him with $fileLink, that it is found in subsetSubsetTimeSeriesWGET.txt

# telling him that fileNamePrefix = the fileName (the data name) minus .tif, keeping the prefix

# then downloading from the URLs in fileLink, which is subsetSubsetTimeSeriesWGET.txt

# when downloaded, cut the region out with gdal_translate command; namely the f$ileName datawhich was downloaded, so each line in the fileLink txt file
# so going down the URLs downloading it (wget $fileLink) from next to next

# afterwards directly save it in the new directory subseDownloads  under each data name  fileNamePrefix which is the data name plus .regionSubset.tif
# so subsetDownloads/${fileNamePrefix}.regionSubset.tif

# with ; telling done. the next command can be done; or while loop is finished with done < fileLink txt file

# when downloaded and afterwards cutted out, and the smaller tif data is saved correctly, we remove the bigger whole world tif data
# rm -f $fileName
# -f = foreced: so you are not being asked all the time a loop round is done
