##### 
# I have the whole big tif data bio 1-3 in the directory
#/data/proj/chilense/30_genomes_outputs/Moritz/climatic_variables/past/chelsa-trace21k_timeseries/

# I just need the 23 timesteps I have listed in the txtFile choosingTimetep.txt
# Tell the computer: from the directory with all tif data, just pick the ones
# that have the numbers which is listed in the choosingTimestep.txt file

# for that: while loop

# then the cutting of the tif data into the subset tif data: for loop
# so a nested for loop in a while loop

# first: list all the chosen tif files (the 23 with `timestep`: the i is the /*_${timeStep}_*
# for all of this: second give them the right name: fileNamePrefix = `basename $i .tif`: this means you want to keep the whole name, but cut off the .tif and put a .tif after the chosen bio numbers
# first loop done: ;

# dann das cutting out: gdal_translate -projwin of the several $i 
# put this into the directory /subsetDownloads
# subsetDownloads/${fileNamePrefix}.region.tif: so give it the prefix name you wanna keep, and kept with basename (thrown away the .tif); then put after the prefix: .regionSubset.tif
#second loop done: ;

# complete loop done: done;


# while loop done: done
# tell it what is the timeStep file: done < choosingTimestep.txt


# basename -s: keeps the suffix, so what your type before, and keeps the first, throws away the second
# basename: cuts out prefix, so throws away what you type second, and keeps the first
